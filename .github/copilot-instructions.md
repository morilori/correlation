This project is a full-stack Comprehension Graph website. The backend is FastAPI (Python) and the frontend is React (Vite, TypeScript). The backend processes text, rewrites it using Ollama LLM, generates Cypher code, and serves it to the frontend. The frontend visualizes the knowledge graph using Cytoscape.js.
